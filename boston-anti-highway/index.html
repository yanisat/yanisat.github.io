              Highway building in United States started after World War I, but the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 quickly sped up the planning and cosntruction. The Act allocated $24.8 billion in highway funding, resulting in what we now know as the Interstate Highway System. The 42,796-mile network of highways drastically changed the landscape of the United States, increasing long-distance mobility and spurring the growth of suburbs and automobiles. A trip across regions of the US that once took weeks now takes hours or days. However, highway engineers opted for efficiency rather than equity, leading to the disruption of many communities, often urban and African American.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1948, the State of Massachusetts had plans for eight highways through and around the Greater Boston Area, threatening to rip apart communities and alter the landscape of the area for the worse. By 1972, seven of the plans had been canceled. Between 1950's and the 1980's, a broad coalition of neighborhood residents, activists, urban planners, academics, and government officials came together to protest these highways and to create new functions for the areas left behind.

                      <p>On February 1, 1948, the Master Highway Plan for the Boston Metropolitan area was published by the Joint Board for the Metropolitan Master Highway Plan, in cooperation with the Department of Public Works, the Public Roads Administration, and the Federal Roads Agency. A number of consultants prepared the plan by conducting traffic studies, specifically evaluating current traffic conditions and modeling the desire lines of the greater Boston Area. These desire lines show connections between people’s intended origins and destinations, and highway routes are intended to increase the efficiency of travel in areas with a high concentration of lines.</p>
                      <p>The study concluded on eight highways for the area: Southeast Expressway, Southwest Expressway, Western Expressway, Northwest Expressway, Northern Expressway, Northeast Expressway, East Boston Expressway, and Belt Route. The image below from the Plan shows the approximate locations of the routes, plus the major desire lines.</p>

                      <p>In what is now a textbook case of what not to do for urban renewal, the Boston Redevelopment Authority marked the West End as a “slum,” razed the whole neighborhood to the ground, and built an underused government center in its place. Enabled by the federal Housing Act of 1949, this effort displaced thousands of largely immigrant families. Boston’s Chinatown was also affected by both highway building and urban renewal. The Central Artery, the extension of the Massachusetts Turnpike into the downtown area, displaced businesses and families in the south and east areas of Chinatown in the 1950’s. The nearby Tufts New England Medical Center also placed pressure on the urban renewal of the edges of Chinatown.

                      <p>Eisenhower entered his presidency and made improving the American road system one of his major goals. He signed the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 into law, providing the stepping stones for a national highway system. Though he was not the first president to advocate for a highway network, the timing and vast American wealth were ideal in post-war 1950’s to focus on domestic infrastructure efforts. Many states already had highways, but they were intrastate and had tolls posted on them in order to pay for construction and maintenance. In contrast, the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 gave states funding to build larger, non-toll highways that would be interconnected.</p>
                      <p>The original purpose of the highway system was to improve movement of defense machinery and weapons around the country, but the system has drastically changed the landscape of America beyond just in the military. The 1956 Act authorized $24.8 billion in funds from 1957 to 1969 to build 40,650 miles (later expanded to 42,796 miles later) of highways by 1972. Many state and city governments took full advantage of this funding, and car companies, oil companies, and business associations were generally all supportive of the highway building.</p>

                      <p>One main pocket of the anti-highway protests surrounded the Inner Belt in Cambridge, MA. In the 1948 master plan, the Inner Belt was routed through the Riverside neighborhood of Cambridge on Lee Street. In 1957, after highway funding became available, the Cambridge Planning Board proposed a new route through a more “blighted” area of Cambridge, in the Cambridgeport neighborhood on Brookline and Elm Streets, threatening to demolish the homes of 1235 families and businesses with 2366 employees. This route would later be solidified in the state's master plan for the Inner Belt in 1962.

                      <p>The seeds of this group started when Fred Salvucci began working at the Boston Redevelopment Authority in 1963 and realized, with his fellow planner Tunney Lee, that the Inner Belt engineering study was biased towards a pro-highway stance. They started conducting studies themselves, and by 1964 joined with sociologist Gordon Fellman, Harvard assistant professor of city planning Chester Hartman, and architects Denis Blackett and Robert Goodman to propose alternate highway routes to the City of Cambridge. This group proposed a route through Portland-Albany Street, which was less disruptive than the Brookline-Elm route, but bordered MIT.

In contrast to Cambridge, where the Inner Belt was still in its planning stage, bulldozers had already cleared 500 homes and many businesses along the Southwest Corridor by 1966. Since this expressway was going to disproportionately affect the black population of Boston, one of the main groups fighting against it was Boston’s Black United Front, through a specific subcommittee set up for the cause, Operation STOP. Other groups that were involved included Irish and Eastern European populations of Jamaica Plain and the League of Women Voters.

They were seeking help regarding mitigating the effects of the planned highway on the neighborhood, since to them, the elevated highway was a given. Jim Morey responded to the call and, in October of 1967, met with JP residents to discuss strategy. UPA helped these residents realize that other areas of Boston had depressed, rather than elevated, highways planned, but since Jamaica Plain was a poorer area than these other neighborhoods, the state was opting for the less costly, but more invasive, option.</p>

                      <p>At the federal level, Governor Sargent appealed to Congress to allow for usage of highway funds for other transportation infrastructure. Tip O’Neill, the Congressman representing North Boston who transitioned from being Majority Whip to Majority Leader around the same time, was also supportive of the anti-highway cause, since many houses in his district would have been demolished to make room for the expressway. John Volpe, who was the governor Massachusetts during the start of the anti-highway movement, had become Nixon’s Secretary of Transportation in 1969 and also advocated for a more holistic look at national transportation planning. With many crucial players in Washington supportive of the mass transit and anti-highway cause and after much debate in Congress, the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1973 passed with authorization for $18 million more in transportation infrastructure funding and allowed for transit projects to receive this funding where interstate plans had been withdrawn.

                <div class="modal-body">
                  <p>In 1947, the California state legislature shifted the focus of highways from multipurpose rural roads to superhighways that went directly into cities from limited towns, through shifting the distribution of funds. California was the first state to have a highway system, and the federal Interstate and Defense Highway Act of 1956 replicated the same focus to the rest of the country. The focus of these acts was on funding, so there was little consideration on how the highways would socially, economically, and environmentally affect cities.</p>
                  <p>San Francisco became one of the first battlegrounds in California to revolt against the new infrastructure policies. The Collier-Burns Act of 1947 promised to make San Francisco’s highways rival those of Los Angeles. It called for 25 miles of elevated skyways through the city, one section of which, titled the Embarcadero, was expedited for construction. Opposition within the city quickly arose against the Embarcadero (which was built and eventually torn down), as well as a cross-city freeway that would connect the Golden Gate Bridge to San Mateo County in the south. William C. Blake, the San Francisco Supervisor, led the revolt on the city side, eventually pulling the federal government into the issue. The situation was characterized by fights of city groups and city planners versus state highway engineers, though of course there were many opposing and supporting voices at both the city and state level. After many close calls, the protestors succeeded, and San Francisco today contains very little of its original highway plans. This case shows how the power struggle regarding highway construction can occur between different levels of government.

                  <p>New York City was the scene for both early highway construction and early anti-highway protests; the stories of the Cross Bronx Expressway and the Lower Manhattan Expressway are a couple of the most notable. The Cross Bronx Expressway was built between 1948 and 1963, carried out by Robert Moses, a city official responsible for much of New York’s landscape. The highway cut through many low income neighborhoods in the Bronx. Even though the neighborhood and partner organizations tried to propose an alternate plan, which would move the route just one block away, Moses would not alter his plan. The movement against the Lower Manhattan Expressway in 1941 to 1968 was more successful. Also planned by Moses, this 10-lane highways was supposed to be an extension of Interstate 78 through SoHo and Little Italy, with 416 buildings proposed for demolition.</p>
                  <p>A coalition of residents, different ethnic groups, intellectuals, laborers, and others led by Jane Jacobs, a neighborhood activist, were successful at stopping the plan from happening. The Cross Bronx Expressway marked the last major highway built in the city, and Moses losing the Lower Manhattan Expressway fight signaled the decline of his reign over New York. This case, arguably the most well-known of the anti-highway revolts, highlights how key individuals shape anti-highway movements.

                  <p>Approached in the 1920’s and planned in 1944, the proposal to connect the Twin Cities became reality as Interstate 94 after the passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956. The route planned between St. Paul and Minneapolis cut through the Prospect Park and Rondo neighborhoods in St. Paul, predominantly African-American neighborhoods, for the sake of efficiency, but spared a richer neighborhood near the university. Downtown business-owners saw the highway as an opportunity to stimulate their businesses, since the vitality of the central business district had been declining for a while. George Herrold, the old city planner, tried to address the issue of equity and proposed a different route, but he was not successful and the city engineers ignored him. Many African-American residents of St. Paul were displaced because of this highway. This case is important because it highlights the issues of class and race institutionalized in planning and engineering practices.

                  <p>Interstates 70, 170, 95, 395, and 83 were all planned to intersect Baltimore in some way between the 1950s and 1981. Opposition by various groups prompted multiple redesigns of the highway layout in and around the city. The result was a network that spared some neighborhoods and destroyed others, and left the now-infamous “Highway to Nowhere” in the middle of the city. A particularly successful group called Movement Against Destruction saved 28,000 housing units and many neighborhoods from demolition. This group was a coalition of different races, ethnic groups, and classes, especially since the highway route was set to go through all types of neighborhoods, both predominantly black and predominantly white. Movement Against Destruction and their partner organizations took the highway battle into the courts, challenging the city on the grounds of both planning procedure and environmental quality. This case highlights how forming interest groups can contribute to successful protests.

                  <p>Birmingham has a long history of racial conflicts, including highway revolts in the 1950’s and 1960’s. The city had racial zoning laws from 1926 until the 1950’s when these laws were struck down by the federal government. Slum clearance and public housing after the racial zoning laws were lifted perpetuated neighborhood segregation in the city. Planning for the interstate highway system began in 1956, and the original plans bisected at least four of Birmingham’s predominantly black neighborhoods, including East Birmingham, East Lake, Smithfield, etc. Some of the routes bisecting these neighborhoods seemed purposeful, especially when the highway curved to avoid a whiter and richer neighborhood. Since the highways displaced so many black residents, they moved elsewhere, such as predominantly white neighborhoods, causing white residents to flee to the suburbs, and Birmingham soon became predominantly black. Ironically, the method used to destroy black neighborhoods actually led to a decrease in segregation in the city.
                  </p>
                  <p>While many neighborhoods lost the fight against the highway engineers, there was one case of successful opposition in the Central City. The Red Mountain Expressway was planned to go through the Central City, displacing about 200 to 400 dwelling units. The Highway Department and the city council refused to listen to the Central City residents, both blacks and whites, who protested the plan. By involving the Alabama State Tenants Organization (ASTO) who took the city to federal court, the protestors were able to change the location of the highway, and, interestingly, also were granted renovations for all of their houses. This case highlights the institutionalized racism in many government efforts and how courts can help efforts that lead to success.
