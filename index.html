	<p>Hi! I'm Yanisa, an SB/MCP student at MIT's Department of Urban Studies and Planning. Within urban planning, I am interested
		in environmental and transportation policy and planning. I'm originally from just outside of Seattle, and I'm excited to
	learn about visualization in this class! </p>
	<p>One of my favorite visualizations is Livemap24, which shows real time tracking of most public transit around the world. </p>
